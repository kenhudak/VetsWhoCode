		<p> 
			Relative to car-hailing, scooters are inexpensive to use—most cost $1 to unlock plus 15 cents a minute. <strong>But they are also controversial.</strong>
			An Instagram account called Bird Graveyard, which proudly chronicles abuse of those using scooters, has more than 80,000 followers. 
			Pedestrian lobbying group Walk San Francisco once created a Facebook album entitled “Scooters Behaving Badly,” with comments that included photos of 
			scooters obstructing traffic and strewn across countless sidewalks.

			Many educators today seek interdisciplinary activities. They are looking for creative ways to infuse STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) 
			into the curriculum. At the same time, they want to teach young people about understanding data, online mapping, GPS, citizen science, community-based service learning, 
			and civic engagement.

			When students collect their own data and map it using <a href="http://www.kenhudak.com" target="_blank"> web-based GIS technology,</a> there is the potential to simultaneously advance all of these goals. 
			While it might sound complicated, setting up and conducting such a project is simpler than ever with recent developments in ArcGIS technology.
