		<h2> About Me </h2>
			<p>I love to use technology to solve administrative problems. <p>
			Throughout my public administration and program management career, Iâ€™ve always looked for innovative digital methods to make tasks more efficient and improve work flows.  
			And since I'm also a huge cartography fan, I've enjoyed building on my vast experience with the ArcGIS software platform to manage agency level digital mapping programs. Utilizing my education in environmental policy, urban planning, Public Administration, and using spatial information to make business decisions has resulted in a high degree of career satisfaction. 
			<p>A majority of my world travel experiences came complimentary with my membership in the United States Army Reserve. Although I am now retired from that adventure in my life, as a Veteran I am proud to have obtained the rank of Chief Warrant Two and be recognized as a subject matter expert in the petroleum distribution and logistics field (a job title formally known as 923A in military jargon). 
			I look forward to bringing my military training in leadership, team building, and the decision making process to civilian employers. I even have a published written article which tackles the challenges of logistics in a combat environment!</p>

			<p>CSS has gone through some major changes since CSS level 1 became a W3C recommendation in December 1996. CSS1 describes the CSS language as well as a simple visual formatting model. CSS2, which became a W3C recommendation in May 1998, builds on CSS1 and adds support for media-specific style sheets (e.g. printers and aural devices), downloadable fonts, element positioning and tables.
			As of this writing, CSS3 is currently under development, and includes more advanced features such as animations, background gradients, multi-column layouts, border images, and more.
